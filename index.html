The objective of the game was to jump from building to building while shooting the enemies. Once you've shot all the enemies a portal would open where you could jump into to enter into the next level. I made this game with the help of Sehaj Brar. </p></div>

The software would map large indoor spaces like campuses, hospitals, and office buildings and would direct you from room to room. We thought that there were many mapping software for roads but none for large areas that are can be easily confused.</p></div>
